### 📌 Dataset

The dataset contains rich customer information including:

* Demographics (age, marital status, education)
* Income and spending levels across multiple product categories
* Children information
* Response to marketing campaigns
* Recency of last purchase

Source: Kaggle — *Customer Personality Analysis Dataset*

### 🧠 Project Objectives

* Identify distinct customer segments based on behavior and demographics
* Understand which customer groups are more responsive to marketing efforts
* Support personalization in future marketing campaigns

These objectives align with Phase A: Business Understanding.

### 🔎 Methodology

The project follows a full data mining lifecycle including:
✔ Data Understanding
✔ Data Preparation
✔ Modeling & Evaluation

Core techniques applied:
1️⃣ **Hierarchical Clustering** — Dendrogram-based segmentation
2️⃣ **K-Medoids Clustering** — Robust against outliers
3️⃣ **Fuzzy Logic Clustering** — Probabilistic membership for overlapping customer groups
4️⃣ **Genetic Algorithm** — Optimize number of clusters (k)

All methods are compared using cluster validation metrics such as silhouette score.

### 🧩 Data Pre-Processing Highlights

* Handling missing values
* Feature engineering:

  * **Total_Spending** (sum of all product expenditures)
  * **Children** (Kidhome + Teenhome)
* Standardization of numerical variables
* Encoding of categorical attributes where needed

This ensures high-quality data for clustering algorithms.
